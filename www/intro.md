#### Welcome to the medrxivr app

[Systematic reviews](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematic_review) seek to bring together the totality of available evidence to answer a pressing research question. They are widely used to inform clincal and public health policy. One such data source is repositories of preprints. 

A preprint is a full draft of a research paper that is shared publicly before it has been peer-reviewed. [medRxiv]() hosts preprints related to the medical, clinical, and related health sciences. To echo the warning on the medRxiv repository, __"preprints are preliminary reports of work that have not been peer-reviewed. They should not be relied on to guide clinical practice or health-related behavior and should not be reported in news media as established information."__

However, despite this limitation, preprints can be useful in overcoming [publication bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publication_bias) which may influence the findings of a systematic review. Publication bias occurs namely that draft research papers may never be published if their results are deemed "not significant" or "not novel" - the registration of preprints prevents this from occuring.

This app was originally designed as an user-friendly interface to the `medrxivr` R package, which allows those performing a  in the health sciences to use complex queries to search for relevent preprint hosted on the medRxiv preprint repository

#### Using the app

To get started, enter a search term (e.g. "coronavirus") into the box below or go to the "Advanced search" tab to design more complex searches. Your search results are presented as a table and are available for easy download as a comma seperated file (CSV). Summary graphics describing your search are presented. Finally, as this app is designed as a companion to the `medrxivr` R package, the code used to perform your search in R is provided, meaning it is readily reproducible.
